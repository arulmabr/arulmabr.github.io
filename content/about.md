I'm Arul Murugan, currently a first-year masters student at the School of Information, UC Berkeley. I'm interested in AI Safety and Alignment.

I'm originally from the southern state of [Tamil Nadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu) in India. Before starting my grad school in Berkeley, I was a research fellow at the [Data Innovation Lab](https://thedatainnovationlab.com), and a founding engineer at [Photon Insights](https://photoninsights.com/). I did my undergrad in Chemical Engineering at [BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/).

I follow Cricket, F1, and a few other sports sparcely. I LOVE watching movies, I have watched a ton of movies and I keep looking out for good ones every month.
